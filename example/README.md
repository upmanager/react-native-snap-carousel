## Example

The example is a basic React Native app, which means you should follow [the official doc](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to get started with it. Make sure to read the instructions found in tab "Building Projects with Native Code".

To sum up:
- make sure that everything you need has been properly installed (Node, Watchman, RN command line interface, XCode...)
- in your Terminal, navigate to the `/example` folder
- execute the following commands:
```bash
npm install
react-native run-ios # or 'react-native run-android'
```

If you want to play with the example, note that the relevant source code is located in the `/example/src` folder.

Have fun!
