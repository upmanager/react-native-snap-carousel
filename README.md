> Since it has been asked multiple times, please note that **we do not plan on Open-Sourcing the code of our showcase app**. Still, we've put together [an example](#example) for you to play with, and you can find some insight about our map implementation [in this comment](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/11#issuecomment-265147385).

App currently uses version 1.4.0 of the plugin. Especially, this means that you should expect **slider's layout to break with RTL devices** (see [#38](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/38)) since support was added in version 2.1.0.

## Breaking change
Since version 2.0.0, items are now **direct children of the <Carousel> component**. As a result, props `items` and `renderItem` have been removed.

## Usage

```
$ npm install --save react-native-snap-carousel
```

```javascript
import Carousel from 'react-native-snap-carousel';

    // Example with different children
    render () {
        return (
            <Carousel
              ref={(carousel) => { this._carousel = carousel; }}
              sliderWidth={sliderWidth}
              itemWidth={itemWidth}
            >
                <View style={styles.slide1} />
                <Text style={styles.slide2} />
                <Image style={styles.slide3} />
            </Carousel>
        );
    }

    // Example of appending the same component multiple times while looping through an array of data
    render () {
        const slides = this.state.entries.map((entry, index) => {
            return (
                <View key={`entry-${index}`} style={styles.slide}>
                    <Text style={styles.title}>{ entry.title }</Text>
                </View>
            );
        });

        return (
            <Carousel
              ref={(carousel) => { this._carousel = carousel; }}
              sliderWidth={sliderWidth}
              itemWidth={itemWidth}
            >
                { slides }
            </Carousel>
        );
    }
```

## Props

### Required

Prop | Description | Type | Default
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
**itemWidth** | Width in pixels of your slides, **must be the same for all of them** | Number | **Required**
**sliderWidth** | Width in pixels of your slider | Number | **Required**

### Behavior

Prop | Description | Type | Default
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
activeSlideOffset | From slider's center, minimum slide distance to be scrolled before being set to active | Number | `25`
enableMomentum | See [momentum](#momentum) | Boolean | `false`
enableSnap | If enabled, releasing the touch will scroll to the center of the nearest/active item | Number | `true`
firstItem | Index of the first item to display | Number | `0`
shouldOptimizeUpdates | whether to implement a `shouldComponentUpdate` strategy to minimize updates | Boolean | `true`
snapOnAndroid | Snapping on android is kinda choppy, especially when swiping quickly so you can disable it | Boolean | `true`
swipeThreshold | Delta x when swiping to trigger the snap | Number | `20`

Prop | Description | Type | Default
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
autoplay | Trigger autoplay on mount | Boolean | `false`
autoplayDelay | Delay before enabling autoplay on startup & after releasing the touch | Number | `5000`
autoplayInterval | Delay in ms until navigating to the next item | Number |  `3000`

### Style and animation

Prop | Description | Type | Default
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
animationFunc | Animated animation to use. Provide the name of the method | String | `timing`

### Callbacks

Prop | Description | Type | Default
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
onScrollViewScroll(event) | Callback fired while scrolling; direct equivalent of `ScrollView`'s `onScroll` | Function | `undefined`
onSnapToItem(slideIndex) | Callback fired when navigating to an item | Function | `undefined`

### `ScrollView`

In addition to these props, you can use **any prop from the [ScrollView component](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/scrollview.html)**.

Here are a few useful ones:`removeClippedSubviews`, `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`, `overScrollMode` (android), `bounces` (ios), `decelerationRate` (ios), `scrollEventThrottle` (ios).

> Since `onScroll` is overriden by plugin's implementation, you should use prop `onScrollViewScroll` if you need a callback while scrolling.

## Methods

### Reference to the component

In order to use the following methods, you need to create a reference to the carousel's instance. There are two ways of doing it.

#### ref as a callback attribute (**recommended**)
```javascript
<Carousel
  // other props
  ref={(carousel) => { this._carousel = carousel; }}
/>

// methods can then be called this way
onPress={() => { this._carousel.snapToNext(); }}
```

#### ref as a string attribute ([legacy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37468913/why-ref-string-is-legacy))
```javascript
<Carousel
  // other props
  ref={'carousel'}
/>

// methods can then be called this way
onPress={() => { this.refs.carousel.snapToNext(); }}
```

### Available methods

* `startAutoplay (instantly = false)` Start the autoplay manually
* `stopAutoplay ()` Stop the autoplay manually
* `snapToItem (index, animated = true)` Snap to an item manually
* `snapToNext (animated = true)` Snap to next item manually
* `snapToPrev (animated = true)` Snap to previous item manually

## Properties

> You need a reference to the carousel's instance (see [above](#reference-to-the-component) if needed).

* `currentIndex` Current active item (`int`, starts at 0)

## Example
You can find the following example in the [/example](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/tree/master/example) folder.

## Tips and tricks

### Momentum

Since `1.5.0`, the snapping effect can now be based on momentum instead of when you're releasing your finger. It means that the component will wait until the `ScrollView` isn't moving anymore to snap. By default, the inertia isn't too high on Android. However, we had to tweak the default iOS value a bit to make sure the snapping isn't delayed for too long.
You can adjust this value to your needs thanks to [this prop](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/scrollview.html#decelerationrate).

> As a rule of thumb, **we recommend setting `enableMomentum` to `false` (default) and `decelerationRate` to `'fast'` when you are displaying only one main slide** (as in the showcase above), and to use `true` and `0.9` otherwise. This should help providing a better snap feeling.

### Margin between slides
If you need some **extra horizontal margin** between slides (besides the one resulting from the scale effect), you should add it as `paddingHorizontal` on slide's container. Make sure to take this into account when calculating item's width.

```javascript
const horizontalMargin = 20;
const slideWidth = 280;

const sliderWidth = Dimensions.get('window').width;
const itemWidth = slideWidth + horizontalMargin * 2;
const itemHeight = 200;

const styles = Stylesheet.create({
    slide: {
        width: itemWidth,
        height: itemHeight
        // other styles for your item's container
    }
};

return (
    <Carousel
      sliderWidth={sliderWidth}
      itemWidth={itemWidth}
    >
        <View style={styles.slide} />
        <View style={styles.slide} />
        <View style={styles.slide} />
    </Carousel>
);

```

### Understanding styles

Here is a screenshot that should help you understand how each of the above variables is used.

![react-native-snap-carousel info](http://i.imgur.com/PMi6aBd.jpg)

### Fullscreen slides

While the plugin hasn't been designed with this use case in mind, you can easily implement fullscreen slides. The following code should serve as a good starting point.

```javascript
const { width: viewportWidth, height: viewportHeight } = Dimensions.get('window');

return (
    <Carousel
      sliderWidth={viewportWidth}
      itemWidth={viewportWidth}
      slideStyle={{ width: viewportWidth }}
      inactiveSlideOpacity={1}
      inactiveSlideScale={1}
    >
        <View style={{ height: viewportHeight }} /> // or { flex: 1 } for responsive height
        <View style={{ height: viewportHeight }} /> // or { flex: 1 } for responsive height
        <View style={{ height: viewportHeight }} /> // or { flex: 1 } for responsive height
    </Carousel>
);
```

### Error with Jest

You might encounter the following error when using the plugin in conjonction with Jest: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of undefined at Object.<anonymous>`.

As you can see [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/jest/setup.js), this is because React Native mocks `ScrollView` for you when you write unit tests with Jest.

The easiest workaround is to add `jest.unmock('ScrollView')` before importing the component in your test file (thanks [@hoangnm](https://github.com/hoangnm) for the tip!).

## RTL support

### Experimental feature

Since version 2.1.0, the plugin is compatible with RTL layouts. Our implementation relies on miscellaneous hacks that work around a [React Native bug](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/11960) with horizontal `ScrollView`.

As such, this feature should be considered experimental since it might break with newer versions of React Native.

### Known issue

There is one kown issue with RTL layouts: during init, the last slide will shortly be seen. You can work around this by delaying slider's visibility with a small timer (FYI, version 0.43.0 of React Native [introduced a `display` style prop](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/4d69f4b2d1cf4f2e8265fe5758f28086f1b67500) that could either be set to `flex` or `none`).
